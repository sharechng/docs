# LAZI Username Multiplier

#### Introduction

The LAZI Username Multiplier is an innovative feature designed to reward our users for actively participating in the LAZI ecosystem. By owning one or more LAZI usernames, users can boost their rewards in engagement mining, staking, and liquidity pool (LP) rewards. This multiplier system encourages user engagement and adds an extra incentive for LAZI users to hold multiple usernames, fostering a strong and active community.

#### LAZI Username Multiplier System

Users can earn additional multipliers by owning up to 5 LAZI usernames. Each username owned results in an incremental increase in the multiplier, as shown below:

| Usernames Held | Username Multiplier |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 1              | 3x                  |
| 2              | 3.5x                |
| 3              | 4x                  |
| 4              | 4.5x                |
| 5 or more      | 5x                  |

Please note that the usernames used to obtain the multiplier will also be staked during the engagement session, staking, or LP rewards, and they will only be unstaked upon the conclusion of the respective program.

#### Applying the LAZI Username Multiplier

1. **Engagement Mining:** The LAZI Username Multiplier is applied to the user's engagement mining rewards, increasing their earnings based on the number of owned LAZI usernames. This incentivizes users to contribute to the platform and rewards active participation.
2. **Staking Rewards:** Users staking their $LAZI tokens will benefit from the LAZI Username Multiplier in addition to the locked staking duration multiplier. The final staking rewards are calculated using the following formula:
   * Earnings = (User's Share in the Pool / Total Pool Share) \* Daily Token Release \* (Locked Staking Duration Multiplier + LAZI Username Multiplier)
3. **Liquidity Pool (LP) Rewards:** For users participating in the LAZI-BNB liquidity pool staking, the LAZI Username Multiplier enhances their rewards in combination with the lock multiplier. The final LP rewards are calculated using the following formula:
   * Earnings = (User's Share in the Pool / Total Pool Share) \* Daily Token Release \* (Lock Multiplier + LAZI Username Multiplier)

#### Conclusion

The LAZI Username Multiplier system serves as an added incentive for users to actively participate in the LAZI ecosystem. By owning multiple LAZI usernames, users can significantly boost their rewards in engagement mining, staking, and liquidity pool rewards, further encouraging commitment to the platform and fostering a robust and active community.
