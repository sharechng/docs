# Engagement Mining

Introducing our innovative rewards mechanism, designed to foster user engagement and encourage active participation in our platform.

Everyday 109,589 $LAZI will be released to reward users for their contributions inside Lazi App.

To partake in our "engage to earn" program, users must initiate an "engagement session" by staking $LAZI tokens for their desired participation period.

Please note, the maximum duration for an engagement session is capped at 2000 days and the user gets their initial amount and rewards earned at the end of the duration of the engagement session.

**Multiplier System:**

The rewards mechanism employs a multiplier that enhances user engagement rewards based on their staking, engagement duration, and .LAZI usernames ownership. The multiplier is calculated using three factors: S, T, and U. To obtain the final multiplier value, these factors are multiplied together using the following formula:

Multiplier = S \* T \* U

Here's an easy-to-understand explanation of each factor:

S - Staking Ratio Factor: This factor assesses the ratio between the user's staked $LAZI tokens and the average staked $LAZI tokens by all users. If the user's staked amount exceeds the average, the ratio will be above 1. If not, the factor will be set to 1.

T - Duration Ratio Factor: This factor evaluates the ratio between the user's engagement session duration and the average duration of all engagement sessions. If the user's duration surpasses the average, the ratio will be above 1. If not, the factor will be set to 1.

U - Username Multiplier: Users can earn additional multipliers by owning up to 5 .LAZI usernames. Each username owned results in an incremental increase in the multiplier, as shown below:

Please note that the usernames used to obtain the multiplier will also be staked during the engagement session, and they will only be unstaked upon its conclusion.

The calculated multiplier (S \* T \* U) is then applied to the user's engagement rewards, increasing their earnings based on their relative stake amount, session duration, and the number of owned .LAZI usernames. By incorporating the staking of usernames, we ensure that users who actively contribute to the platform are rewarded accordingly.

**Engagement Mining:**

Engagement mining rewards are determined by the following equation:

Rewards = w1 \* Contribution Score + w2 \* Duration + w3 \* Staked Amount

w1, w2, and w3 represent the specific weights attributed to the engagement mining factors, which determine the daily token distribution proportions. Initially, these weights will be set as w1 = 50%, w2 = 35%, and w3 = 15%. These weights may be adjusted as the project progresses to optimize platform performance.

**Contribution Score:**

The contribution score is a measure designed to evaluate a user's involvement and positive impact on the social media platform. It considers a variety of aspects that demonstrate user engagement and contribution, including:

a. Content creation: This factor examines both the frequency and quality of the content generated by the user within the app.

b. Interactions with other users: This takes into account the user's active participation in discussions, collaborations, and connections with other members of the platform.

c. NFT-related activities: This involves the user's engagement in buying and selling new posts as NFTs within the app, showcasing their support for the creative community.

d. Network growth: This factor recognizes the user's efforts in inviting new users to the app and encouraging their participation by liking, commenting, or purchasing their posts.

e. Platform support: Users who maintain good behavior and contribute to a positive environment by reporting inappropriate conduct or content to the community will be recognized in their contribution score.

In order to maintain fairness and prevent gaming the system, the specific weights assigned to each of these factors in the contribution score calculation will not be disclosed. This approach ensures that users are motivated to actively participate and contribute to the platform in a genuine and **balanced manner.**

**Duration and Stake Amount:**

Duration: (user's engagement session duration / total duration of all engagement sessions) \* duration rewards for the day

Stake amount: (user's staked amount / total staked amount) \* staking rewards for the day

**Penalties for Early Engagement Session Termination:**

Users may choose to end their engagement session early but will incur penalties on both staked amount and rewards, as follows:

1. If the engagement session is terminated before completing 50% of the initially set duration:

* Earned rewards: 50% reduction
* Initial staked amount: 30% reduction

2. If the engagement session is terminated between 50% and 80% of the initially set duration:

* Earned rewards: 25% reduction
* Initial staked amount: 15% reduction

3. If the engagement session is terminated after completing 80% of the initially set duration:

* Earned rewards: 15% reduction
* Initial staked amount: 5% reduction

Half of the incurred penalty will be allocated to the creator wallet, while the other half will be added to the reward pool for the following day, distributed among engagement miners accordingly.

By implementing this rewards mechanism, we aim to create an engaging and thriving ecosystem that benefits all users who actively participate in the platform. Our intention is to encourage meaningful interactions, content creation, and community growth while maintaining a fair and transparent system for everyone involved.
