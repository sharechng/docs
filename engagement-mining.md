# Engagement Mining

1\. Total Supply and Annual Inflation:

&#x20;  \- Total supply: 1 billion.

&#x20;  \- Annual inflation: 4%.

&#x20;

2\. Daily Release for Engaging Users:

&#x20;  \- Daily release: 109,589 $LAZI.

3\. Engage to Earn Program:

&#x20;  \- Stake $LAZI to start.

&#x20;  \- Max session duration: 2000 days.

&#x20;  \- Initial amount and rewards at session end.

&#x20;

4\. Multiplier System: S \* T \* U:

&#x20;  \- S (Staking Ratio Factor):

&#x20;     \- Compares user's staked $LAZI to the average.

&#x20;     \- If user's staked amount exceeds average, S is taken as that ratio; otherwise, it's set to 1.

&#x20;

&#x20;  \- T (Duration Ratio Factor):

&#x20;     \- Assesses user's engagement session duration versus the average.

&#x20;     \- If user's duration surpasses average, T is taken as that ratio; else, it's set to 1.

&#x20;

&#x20;  \- U (Username Multiplier):

&#x20;     \- Users gain extra multipliers for owning up to 5 .LAZI usernames.

&#x20;     \- Each owned username increases the multiplier.

&#x20;

5\. Engagement Mining Rewards Equation:

&#x20;  \- Rewards = w1 \* Contribution Score + w2 \* Duration + w3 \* Staked Amount.

&#x20;

&#x20;  Explanation:

&#x20;  \- w1: Contribution Score holds 50% weight.

&#x20;  \- w2: Duration contributes 35% to daily token distribution.

&#x20;  \- w3: Staked Amount factors in with a 15% weight.

&#x20;

6\. Weight Adjustments:

&#x20;  \- Initial weights: w1 = 50%, w2 = 35%, w3 = 15%.

&#x20;  \- Adjustments for platform optimization.



### Penalties for Early Engagement Session Termination:

\- Termination before 50% of initially set duration:
